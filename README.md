### Reinforcement Learning Playground

Some files I make while I try to seriously teach myself reinforcement learning. This file will track my progress:

Have done:
1. Used open ai gym with some trivial agents to get a feel for the agent environment abstraction.
2. Implemented a grid world and policy iteration agent. Very bare bones stuff and agent is still buggy.
3. Did cs188 project: value iteration agent and q learning agent.
 
Next: Apply progress to CHaRLy. Specifically, create the MDP/sMDP abstraction and implement naive agents.
